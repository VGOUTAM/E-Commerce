It is an E-commerce website (still under build) . The frontend has been created using ReactJS.<br />
Several concepts of ReactJS hae been implemented in it. <br />
The sites contains a authentication feature enabled using "bcrypt" provided by NodeJS. <br />
Database has been hosted on MongoDB Atlas.<br /><br />

Whenever a user creates a new account by clicking sign-up link on the navbar, the details entered are stored in the database along with the password.<br />
But the password is stored in an encrypted form that cannot be decoded easily due to "bcrypt" encryption.
